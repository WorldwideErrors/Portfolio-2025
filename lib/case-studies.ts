      edit configuration files manually. This enhances the user experience by providing in-game commands for adding, 
      removing and editting broadcasts. They can choose to have broadcasts appear randomly or in a specific sequence, 
      and set default intervals for automatic repetition. `,

      that only authorized players can manage broadcasts, enhancing server security and control. Overall, the Scheduled 
      Broadcaster plugin streamlines broadcast management, making it more accessible and efficient for server administrators.

      heading: `CM.com provides company cars that allow employees to travel between different offices 
        and meet each other in person. However, with a workforce of over 700 employees and a limited number of company cars, 
        it’s important to use these resources smartly and efficiently. CM.com is committed to sustainability 
        and aims to approach mobility in an intelligent and eco-friendly way. We’re going green! 
        The goal is to develop a website where employees can plan and share their rides. By viewing each other’s travel plans, 
        they can discover opportunities to carpool to the office together. This is not only more environmentally friendly 
        but also helps foster a fun and informal atmosphere during the ride!`,

      body: `The student team consisted of six developers with different roles, including frontend, backend, full-stack, 
        and scrum master. Collaboration took place via Teams, WhatsApp, and daily stand-ups. 
        The application was built using a modern architecture: the backend follows the Onion Architecture in .NET, 
        while the frontend was developed in Angular using the MVVM pattern. Key features include user and car management, 
        reservations and carpool requests, an integrated calendar, and intuitive dashboards. Through CI/CD pipelines in Azure, 
        the software was automatically tested and deployed, ensuring a reliable and maintainable delivery. 
        Comprehensive documentation, wireframes, ERDs, and use cases guarantee the system’s scalability 
        and future expandability.`,

      conclusion: `The end result is a user-friendly and sustainable web application that enables CM.com employees 
        to easily reserve company cars and share rides. Thanks to the modern architecture, testing strategy, 
        and automated deployment, the application is stable, scalable, and ready for future use. 
        This project actively contributes to CM.com’s commitment to greener business operations and a more efficient way 
        of traveling within the company.`
